# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description:
This is a simple implementation of the classic game `Tic Tac Toe` using Python and the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface. The game board is represented as a `numpy` array of zeros, where player 1 (❌) and player 2 (⭕) are represented by 1 and 2, respectively. The game starts with player 1 and alternates turns between the players until one of them wins or the game ends in a tie.

The game interface is created using tkinter buttons, with each button representing a cell on the board. The buttons are colored differently for each player and become disabled after being clicked to prevent further interaction. The winner is displayed on a label below the board, and the game ends once a winner is declared or all cells are filled.

In addition to human players, the game also has a simple computer player that makes `random` moves on the board.

## Getting Started:
To use this program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official Python website [(https://www.python.org)].

Once you have Python installed, you can download the `tictactoe.py` file from this repository and run it using the command `python tictactoe.py`.

## Usage:
To play the game, simply run the code and a GUI window will appear. Click on a button to make a move, and the game will automatically alternate between players and update the board and winner label. To exit the game, simply close the GUI window.
