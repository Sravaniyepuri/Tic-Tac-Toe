# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python's Tkinter library and NumPy
# Python Tkinter Tic Tac Toe
This is a Python Tkinter program that allows users to play Tic Tac Toe against the computer.

# Getting Started
To use this program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official Python website.

Once you have Python installed, you can download the tictactoe.py file from this repository and run it using the command 'python tictactoe.py'.

# Usage
When you run the program, you will see a 3x3 grid of buttons. You can click on a button to place your symbol (either ❌ or ⭕) on the board. The computer will automatically make its move after you make yours.

If you get three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), you win the game! If the board is full and no one has won, the game is a tie.
